# Ubuntu Membership Workshop

## What is Ubuntu Membership?

[Main Page](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership)

 **Official Ubuntu Membership means recognition of significant and sustained contribution to Ubuntu or the Ubuntu community.**

 It can be done via Upstream or via work within the Ubuntu Community, such as translations or documentation.

### Benefits

While the benefits of Membership can apply to the the individual, it also applies the whole Ubuntu Community.  It also can reach out into the greater Open Source community. These benefits include:

### For the Individuals

* Provides a recognition of significant, sustained, and continued contributions.

* Suggests you're serious about your contributions and you'll be there if someone wants to find you (gives you credibility).

* Allows the creation of a sort of Ubuntu resum√© that could be used with potential employers (the testimonials could be independently verified through the wiki history).

* Gives you clout within the larger world, since you essentially work for Ubuntu.

* Acts as a commitment on the part of the team to engage and include the individual.

* Gives you something to be proud of: being a member of a team of wonderful people around the world trying to make the world's software better.

### For the Communities (Ubuntu and Open Source)

* The commitment that you give gives credibility to the community that will ensure it retains good people and makes the best out of investments in training (resources are limited).

* Membership is not a statement of how great one is, but a commitment to the team and the community.

### Perks

#### Ubuntu Community

 * Voting privileges to confirm Ubuntu Community Council nominations.

### Other Stuff

#### What sort of contributions are counted

- **Please note that karma on Launchpad isn't the biggest factor and will only be considered if necessary**
- Translations
- Bug triage
- Code
- Quality Assurance
- Community building
- Being active in your Local Community Team (LoCo)
- Writing/proofreading documentation
- Artwork
- IRC/Mailing List Support

#### The best practices at recognizing contributions from others

- Give public thanks (on social media, blog posts, during meetings)
for work completed
- Share work completed by other contributors (even if you weren't
involved, a retweet/share goes a long way to showing people their work
is appreciated)
- Submit announcements/posts of good work in the community you find
to the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter so it can be shared with the broader
community
- Write a testimonial when they go for Membership

#### The contribution threshold at which you should coach others toward applying for membership
#### How involved (or hands-off) to be during their application

- Write a testimonial on their wiki page
- At the meeting, cheer for them when the time comes

#### Ubuntu Membership via [Forums](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Forums/Membership) contributions

##### Qualifications

You need to:

 * Have been active on the forums for at least six months.

   * As a guideline, you need about 1,000 posts in support areas. Spam reports are included in this number.

 * Be helpful and encouraging to others.

 * Be offering some form of technical support, which can be at a basic level. (You can't get membership if you spend nearly all your time posting in the chat areas.)

 * Have no recent infractions or any major infractions.

You do **NOT** need to be a developer or to have expert knowledge of a topic.

The main thing is to be encouraging to people who are struggling, and to make sure that any advice you give is correct, up to date, and promotes best practices.

## What are the steps?

### Registering on Launchpad

**I plan to screenshare this part.**

### How to sign the Ubuntu Code of Conduct (CoC)

**I plan to screenshare this part.**

There are a few ways to get a key and to sign the CoC with [Open GPG Key](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto).

### How to announce when a new member applies

Once you sign up for a slot on the [Boards](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards), the best suggestion is to e-mail the mailing lists of the teams that you are a part of and ask for them to write a testimonial or come to cheer you on at the meeting.

### How to announce when a new member is approved

A member of the Board can only announce who was approved and it will be posted on the [Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuWeeklyNewsletter/). It will look similar to this:

The following new Ubuntu Members were welcomed during the the [insert date here] Ubuntu Membership Board meeting:

- Name [wiki page|Launchpad page]

[Link to Ubuntu News Mailing List Thread]

### Renewal

Once added to the team, you will get an e-mail every two (2) years asking if you want to renew your membership on Launchpad. There is a deadline, which is seven (7) days, to renew your membership on Launchpad, but if you miss that, e-mail the membership board and we will add you back.
