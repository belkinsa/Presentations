# Ubuntu Membership Workshop

## What is Ubuntu Membership?

[Main Page](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership)

 Official Ubuntu Membership means recognition of significant and sustained contribution to Ubuntu or the Ubuntu community.

 It can be done via Upstream or via work within the Ubuntu Community, such as tranlations or writing docuemenation.

### Benefits

While the benefits of Membership can apply to the the individual, it also applies the whole Ubuntu Community.  It also can reach out into the greater Open Source community. These benefits include:

### For the Individuals

* Provides a recognition of significant, sustained, and continued contributions.

* Suggests you're serious about your contributions and you'll be there if someone wants to find you (gives you credibility).

* Allows the creation of a sort of Ubuntu resum√© that could be used with potential employers (the testimonials could be independently verified through the wiki history).

* Gives you clout within the larger world, since you essentially work for Ubuntu.

* Acts as a commitment on the part of the team to engage and include the individual.

* Gives you something to be proud of: being a member of a team of wonderful people around the world trying to make the world's software better.

### For the Communities (Ubuntu and Open Source)

* The commitment that you give gives credibility to the community that will ensure it retains good people and makes the best out of investments in training (resources are limited).

* Membership is not a statement of how great one is, but a commitment to the team and the community.
