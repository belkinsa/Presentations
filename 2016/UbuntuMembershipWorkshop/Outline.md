# Ubuntu Membership Workshop

## What is Ubuntu Membership?

[Main Page](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership)

 Official Ubuntu Membership means recognition of significant and sustained contribution to Ubuntu or the Ubuntu community.

 It can be done via Upstream or via work within the Ubuntu Community, such as tranlations or writing docuemenation.

### Benefits

While the benefits of Membership can apply to the the individual, it also applies the whole Ubuntu Community.  It also can reach out into the greater Open Source community. These benefits include:

### For the Individuals

* Provides a recognition of significant, sustained, and continued contributions.

* Suggests you're serious about your contributions and you'll be there if someone wants to find you (gives you credibility).

* Allows the creation of a sort of Ubuntu resum√© that could be used with potential employers (the testimonials could be independently verified through the wiki history).

* Gives you clout within the larger world, since you essentially work for Ubuntu.

* Acts as a commitment on the part of the team to engage and include the individual.

* Gives you something to be proud of: being a member of a team of wonderful people around the world trying to make the world's software better.

### For the Communities (Ubuntu and Open Source)

* The commitment that you give gives credibility to the community that will ensure it retains good people and makes the best out of investments in training (resources are limited).

* Membership is not a statement of how great one is, but a commitment to the team and the community.

### Perks

#### Ubuntu Membership via [Forums](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Forums/Membership) contributions

##### Qualifications

You need to:

 * have been active on the forums for at least six months.

   * As a guideline, you need about 1,000 posts in support areas. Spam reports are included in this number.

 * be helpful and encouraging to others.

 * be offering some form of technical support, which can be at a basic level. (You can't get membership if you spend nearly all your time posting in the chat areas.)

 * have no recent infractions or any major infractions.

You **do NOT need** to be a developer or to have expert knowledge of a topic.

The main thing is to be encouraging to people who are struggling, and to make sure that any advice you give is correct and up to date and promotes best practices.

### How to announce when a new member applies

Once you sign up for a slot on the [Boards](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Membership/Boards), the best suggestion is to e-mail the mailing-lists of the teams that you are apart of and ask for them to write testimonial or come to cheer you on at the meeting.

### How to announce when a new member is approved

A member of the Board can only announce who was approved and it will be posted on the Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter.
